# n7-inverse-problems

In this project, our main goal was to solve an inverse problem of the form $y = Hx + n$, with a sparse signal $x$, Gaussian noise $n$ and convolution matrix $H$. To do so we will make use of simulation following probability laws and descent algorithms for convex optimization, which will be introduced in parts I and II before being used to solve the inverse problem in part III.
