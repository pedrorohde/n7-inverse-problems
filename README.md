# n7-inverse-problems

In this project, our main goal was to solve an inverse problem of the form _y = Hx + n_, with a sparse signal _x_, Gaussian noise _n_ and convolution matrix _H_. To do so we will make use of simulation following probability laws and descent algorithms for convex optimization, which will be introduced in parts I and II before being used to solve the inverse problem in part III.
